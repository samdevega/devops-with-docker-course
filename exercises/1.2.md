# Exercise 1.2: Cleanup

We have containers and an image that are no longer in use and are taking up space. Running `docker ps -a` and `docker image ls` will confirm this.

Clean the Docker daemon by removing all images and containers.
```
docker container rm <php_container_id> <tomcat_container_id>
docker rmi <php_image_id> <tomcat_image_id>
```

Submit the output for `docker ps -a` and `docker images`.
```
CONTAINER ID            IMAGE           COMMAND                 CREATED               STATUS
<nginx_container_id>    nginx           "/docker-entrypoint.â€¦"  About 2 minutes ago   Up 2 minutes
```

```
REPOSITORY  TAG       IMAGE ID          CREATED       SIZE
nginx       latest    <nginx_image_id>  3 weeks ago   188MB
```
