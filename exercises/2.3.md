# Mandatory Exercise 2.3

As we saw previously, starting an application with two programs was not trivial and the commands got a bit long.

In the previous part we created Dockerfiles for both frontend and backend of the example application. Next, simplify the usage into one docker-compose.yml.

Configure the backend and frontend from part 1 to work in Docker Compose.

Submit the docker-compose.yml

---
```
services:
  backend:
    image: backend-project:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    container_name: "backend-project-2.3"
  frontend:
    image: frontend-project:latest
    ports:
      - "80:5000"
    container_name: "frontend-project-2.3"
```
