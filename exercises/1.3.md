# Exercise 1.3: Secret message

Now that we've warmed up it's time to get inside a container while it's running!

Image devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:ubuntu will start a container that outputs logs into a file. Go inside the running container and use tail -f ./text.log to follow the logs. Every 10 seconds the clock will send you a "secret message".

Submit the secret message and command(s) given as your answer.
```
docker run --rm devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:ubuntu
```
```
Starting log output
Wrote text to /usr/src/app/text.log
```

```
docker exec -it <ubuntu_container_id> tail -f ./text.log
```
```
Secret message is: 'You can find the source code here: https://github.com/docker-hy'
```
