# Mandatory Exercise 1.13: Hello, backend!

Clone, fork or download a project from https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/example-backend.

Create a Dockerfile for the project (example-backend). Start the container with port 8080 published.

When you start the container and navigate to http://localhost:8080/ping you should get a "pong" as a response.

Submit the Dockerfile and the command used.

*Do not alter the code of the project*

TIPS:

* you might need this
* If you have M1/M2 Mac, you might need to build the image with an extra option `docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t imagename .`
