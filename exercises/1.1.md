# Exercise 1.1: Getting started

Since we already did "Hello, World!" in the material let's do something else.

Start 3 containers from an image that does not automatically exit (such as nginx) in detached mode.
```
docker run -d nginx
docker run -d php:fpm-alpine
docker run -d tomcat
```

Stop two of the containers and leave one container running.
```
docker stop <tomcat_container_id> <php_container_id>
```

Submit the output for `docker ps -a` which shows 2 stopped containers and one running.
```
CONTAINER ID            IMAGE           COMMAND                 CREATED             STATUS
<tomcat_container_id>   tomcat          "catalina.sh run"       About a minute ago  Exited (143) 10 seconds ago
<php_container_id>      php:fpm-alpine  "docker-php-entrypoi…"  About a minute ago  Exited (0) 10 seconds ago
<nginx_container_id>    nginx           "/docker-entrypoint.…"  About a minute ago  Up 1 minute
```
