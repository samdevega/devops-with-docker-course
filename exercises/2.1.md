# Exercise 2.1

Let us now leverage the Docker Compose with the simple webservice that we used in the [Exercise 1.3](1.3.md)

Without a command `devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service` will create logs into its `/usr/src/app/text.log`.

Create a docker-compose.yml file that starts `devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service` and saves the logs into your filesystem.

Submit the docker-compose.yml, and make sure that it works simply by running `docker compose up` if the log file exists.

```
services:
  simple-web-service:
    image: devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service
    build: .
    volumes:
      - ./text.log:/usr/src/app/text.log
    container_name: simple-web-service
```
