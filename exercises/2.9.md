# Exercise 2.9

Most of the buttons may have stopped working in the example application. Make sure that every button for exercises works.

Remember to take a peek into the browser's developer consoles again like we did back [part 1](./1.14.md), remember also [this](./1.12/README.md) and [this](./1.13/README.md).

The buttons of the Nginx exercise and the first button behave differently but you want them to match.

If you had to make any changes explain what you did and where.

Submit the docker-compose.yml and both Dockerfiles.
