Exercise 2.4

In this exercise you should expand the configuration done in [Exercise 2.3](./2.3.md) and set up the example backend to use the key-value database [Redis](https://redis.io/).

Redis is quite often used as a cache to store data so that future requests for data can be served faster.

The backend uses a slow API to fetch some information. You can test the slow API by requesting `/ping?redis=true` with curl. The frontend app has a button to test this.

So you should improve the performance of the app and configure a Redis container to cache information for the backend. The [documentation](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/) of the Redis image might contain some useful info.

The backend [README](./1.13/README.md) should have all the information that is needed for configuring the backend.

When you've correctly configured the button will turn green.

Submit the docker-compose.yml

The [restart: unless-stopped](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/05-services/#restart) configuration can help if the Redis takes a while to get ready.
