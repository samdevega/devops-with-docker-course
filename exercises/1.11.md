# Exercise 1.11: Spring

Create a Dockerfile for an old Java Spring project that can be found from the course repository.

The setup should be straightforward with the README instructions. Tips to get you started:

There are many options for running Java, you may use eg. amazoncorretto `FROM amazoncorretto:_tag_` to get Java instead of installing it manually. Pick the tag by using the README and Docker Hub page.

You've completed the exercise when you see a 'Success' message in your browser.

Submit the Dockerfile you used to run the container.
